# calculadora_imc(BMI Calculator)
Hi!
Here I made a simple calculator that gets the person height and weight to return it's BMI(Body Mass Index).
It consists in a single page with HTML5 and CSS, with Javascript doing the math and manipulating DOM to write it to the user.

You can see a litte preview below.
